# HoloDB
A relational database of Hololive talent focused on organizing published music. Also personal database design practice. My aim is to learn how to write SQL scripts and publish SQL projects like the open source Chinook Database.

## To do
SQL DB Project;

Actually including proper descriptions like a README should have for the files;

Google Sheets with readability prioritized;

CSVs for original music published on YouTube and Spotify;

Try to source for privated/deleted/otherwise commonly unavailable original music;

Create a by year compilation video of original music for documentational and promotional purposes;

Provide published Google Sheets link for accessability

## Completed
